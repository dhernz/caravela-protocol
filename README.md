**Composable Protocol for Decentralized Consumer dApps**

**We act as an aggregator of consumer modules to streamline decentralized dApp creation.**



## Problem:
An [empty Ethereum block](https://etherscan.io/block/18482360) on Nov 2, 2023 underscores our underutilization of available blockspace, and a fragmented infrastructure is hindering dApp growth.



## Solution:  
A protocol that aggregates key components necessary to facilitate the creation of useful consumer apps, accelerating the adoption for decentralized ecosystems.  


Components: 
1. (item)
2. (item)
3. (item)
4. (item)
5. (item)


## How big this could be

App Store Saturation Vs. dApp Opportunity: 
Traditional app stores are saturated with 4.23m apps combined (Apple + Google). 
In contrast, there are only 15k dApps across 53 chains. 
dApps have only tapped into 0.35% of the traditional app market size.

The B2B SaaS TAM (total addressable market) in 2023 is estimated to be $197 billion and is expected to reach $232 billion by 2024. (Statista)



## Why now?

- In the last 3 years, there’s been massive improvements in infrastructure
- More than ever it’s necessary to leverage the existing infrastructure 
- Data costs are approaching their minimums
- Who’s going to consume all of the L2 blockspace?

**dUAW Momentum**: A 15% jump in dApp interactions since Q2 2023 highlights rising consumer engagement, hitting 2.2m dUAW!

**Scaling Upgrade**: With Dencun on the horizon and EIP4844 (hello, proto-danksharding!) inbound, Ethereum is about to offer an even cheaper blockspace, the 'blobspace'. 

**Diverse Protocol Progress**: Ethereum's not alone; multiple protocols are racing to perfect cheap data availability. 



## How we are solving it
