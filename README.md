**Composable Protocol for Decentralized Consumer dApps**

**We act as an aggregator of consumer modules to streamline decentralized dApp creation.**



## Problem:
An [empty Ethereum block](https://etherscan.io/block/18482360) on Nov 2, 2023 underscores our underutilization of available blockspace, and a fragmented infrastructure is hindering dApp growth.



## Solution:  
A protocol that aggregates key components necessary to facilitate the creation of useful consumer apps, accelerating the adoption for decentralized ecosystems.  


Components: 
1. Payments
2. Identity
3. Authentication
4. Deployments
5. Social
6. Incentive Mechanisms


## Opportunity

App Store Saturation Vs. dApp: 

Traditional app stores are saturated with 4.23m apps combined (Apple + Google). 

In contrast, there are only 15k dApps across 53 chains. 

dApps have only tapped into 0.35% of the traditional app market size.

The B2B SaaS TAM (total addressable market) in 2023 is estimated to be $197 billion and is expected to reach $232 billion by 2024. (Statista)



## Why now?

- In the last 3 years, there’ve been massive improvements in infrastructure.

- Data costs are approaching their minimums.

- More than ever, it’s necessary to leverage existing infra to build apps people will actually use. 

**dUAW Momentum**: A 15% jump in dApp interactions since Q2 2023 highlights rising consumer engagement, hitting 2.2m dUAW.

**Scaling Upgrade**: With Dencun on the horizon and EIP4844 (hello, proto-danksharding!) inbound, Ethereum is about to offer an even cheaper blockspace, the 'blobspace'. 

**Diverse Protocol Progress**: Ethereum's not alone; multiple protocols are racing to perfect cheap data availability.
